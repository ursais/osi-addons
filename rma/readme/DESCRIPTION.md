A Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA), is a part of the process of
returning a product in order to receive a refund, replacement, or repair
during the product's warranty period.

The purchaser of the product must contact the manufacturer (or
distributor or retailer) to obtain authorization to return the product.

The resulting RMA number must be displayed on or included in the
returned product's packaging.

The issuance of an RMA is a key gatekeeping moment in the reverse
logistics cycle, providing the vendor with a final opportunity to
diagnose and correct the customer's problem with the product (such as
improper installation or configuration) before the customer permanently
relinquishes ownership of the product to the manufacturer, commonly
referred to as a return.

As returns are costly for the vendor and inconvenient for the customer,
any return that can be prevented benefits both parties.
