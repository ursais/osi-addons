The Odoo Subscription module:

* provides different stages for a subscription:
  Draft, In Progress, To Upsell, Closed.
* supports multiples lines of services within a subscription
* Services of a subscription in progress can be modified
  (product, description, quantity, unit price), added or removed.

Some organizations need to be able to suspend a running subscription based on some rules:

* Customer has invoices that are overdue by more than X period of time
  (weeks, months) of the subscription (dynamic credit limit)
* Customer has at least one invoice that is overdue by X days
  (configurable on the customer, by default = 15 days)

This module allows you to define credit and overdue control with dynamic limit based on subscriptions.

Usage
=====

* Go to Contacts
* Create or select a partner
* Go to the "Financial risk" tab
* Set the credit limit type: "Fixed Amount" or "Based on Subscriptions" and their attributes
* Set the overdue limit

A scheduled action will run everyday to update the subscriptions
(suspend or not) based on the customer credit and overdue statuses.
