This module enhances the Product Configurator MRP Quantity functionality
by introducing dynamic quantity adjustments within the Product
Configurator Wizard. Users can now define specific attributes that allow
for quantity variations during the configuration process.

The quantity field becomes visible only when a specific checkbox is
selected on the corresponding attribute line within the product
template.

By default, the quantity field displays a value of "1" which can be
modified by the user during configuration.

This functionality offers greater flexibility and customization for
users by enabling:

Configurable Quantity Adjustments: Define attributes that directly
impact the quantity of materials required for a product based on user
selection. Streamlined MRP Integration: Dynamic quantity adjustments
automatically reflect in the Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
process, ensuring accurate inventory calculations.
