the EU One-Stop-Shop law, that concerns many companies that carry out
distance sales.

EU taxes have been checked in

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings > Taxes*.
2. You can see that user can choose *Add new taxes* for applying EU
   taxes regarding OSS.
3. Select the company where you want to add these new taxes.
4. Select the EU countries where you can send your goods.
5. Select if you want these new taxes to be configured as included in
   price.
6. Select the general, reduced, super reduced and second super reduced
   taxes according your accounting plan.
7. Remember that you shouldn't configure unexisting taxes for your
   accounting plan.
8. Click *Create Fiscal Positions and Taxes* button to continue.
9. According your configuration, new taxes and fiscal positions will be
   created.

**NOTE**: You should use account_fiscal_position_partner_type module
configuration for making the workflow easier.

Usage
=====

After the corresponding configuration of this module:

1. Create a new partner and assign an EU country (different from the one
   set in your company).
2. Check that this new partner has been configured as a *Customer* in
   *Fiscal Position Type* field.
3. Create a new product and set its taxes.
4. Create a new Quotation for the customer and add the new product in a
   sale order line.
5. User will see that taxes will be set according the delivery address
   country taxation.
6. You can create directly an invoice without starting from a SO and the
   pertinent taxes will be applied as well.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

1. This module doesn't take into account if one or more products have
   different type of taxes in the destination contry.
2. There are some countries (for example Spain) that have different
   taxes depending on the region (Canary islands). These use cases
   haven't been considered.
3. There are some countries (for example Cyprus) that have uncommon
   reduced taxes, depending on the typology of the sold product. In
   Cyprus, it happens with *Supply of goods and services of a kind
   normally intended for use in agricultural production but excluding
   capital goods such as machinery or buildings* where an 8% of VAT has
   to be applied instead of the common reduced type. These use cases
   haven't been considered.
