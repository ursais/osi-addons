This module allows the user to create Attributes to any model. This is a
basic module in the way that **it does not provide views to display
these new Attributes.**

Each Attribute created will be related to an **existing field** (in case
of a *"native"* Attribute) or to a newly **created field** (in case of a
*"custom"* Attribute).

A *"custom"* Attribute can be of any type : Char, Text, Boolean, Date,
Binary... but also Many2one or Many2many.

In case of m2o or m2m, these attributes can be related to **custom
options** created for the Attribute, or to **existing Odoo objects**
from other models.

Last but not least an Attribute can be **serialized** using the Odoo SA
module
`base_sparse_field <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/tree/16.0/addons/base_sparse_field>`__
. It means that all the serialized attributes will be stored in a single
"JSON serialization field" and will not create new columns in the
database (and better, it will not create new SQL tables in case of
Many2many Attributes), **increasing significantly the requests speed**
when dealing with thousands of Attributes.

Usage
=====

Even if this module does not provide views to display some model's
Attributes, it provides however a Technical menu in *Settings >
Technical > Database Structure > Attributes* to **create new
Attributes**.

An Attribute is related to both an Attribute Group and an Attribute Set
:

-  The **Attribute Set** is related to the *"model's category"*, i.e.
   all the model's instances which will display the same Attributes.

-  The **Attribute Group** is related to the *"attribute's category"*.
   All the attributes from the same Attribute Set and Attribute Group
   will be displayed under the same field's Group in the model's view.

      ðŸ”Ž In order to create a custom Attribute many2one or many2many
      related to **other Odoo model**, you need to activate the
      Technical Setting **"Advanced Attribute Set settings"**
      (``group_advanced_attribute_set``).

--------------

If you want to create a module displaying some specific model's
Attributes :

1. Your model must **\_inherit the mixin**
   ``"attribute.set.owner.mixin"``
2. You need to **add a placeholder**
   ``<separator name="attributes_placeholder" />`` at the desired
   location in the model's form view.
3. Finally, **add a context** ``{"include_native_attribute": True}`` on
   the action leading to this form view if the model's view needs to
   display attributes related to native fields together with the other
   "custom" attributes.
