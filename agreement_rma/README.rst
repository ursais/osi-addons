Agreement / RMA
===============

Odoo Agreement App does not provide an easy way to access RMAs related to an agreement.
Some organizations needs to have a quick access to RMAs to track the performance of an agreement.

This module allows you to link a RMA to an agreement and adds a smart button
on the agreement to look at the list of related RMAs.

Installation
============

You need to have the rma modules from https://github.com/eficent/stock-rma in
your addons_path.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to Inventory > Customer RMA > RMA
* Select or create a RMA and set the agreement
* Go to Agreement > Agreements
* Open the previous agreement
* Click on the smart button "RMAs" to see the list of related RMAs
