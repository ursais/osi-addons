Usage
=====

Using this module we can project the future forecasting of needed Products from Blanket Orders.
Create a blanket order, adding lines and scheduled dates.
On confirmation, if the product line is a manufactured product an MPS will be created.
When lines are released to Sales Orders or the original qty is updated, then MPS is also updated.
