This module allows to display product's Attributes in product form views
thanks to the
`attribute_set <https://github.com/akretion/odoo-pim/tree/12.0/attribute_set>`__
module. It also adds a suggested link between product's Category and
product's Attribute Set.

However this module **does not provide an Attribute menu** to easily
manage product's Attribute as this feature is covered by the
`pim_attribute_set <https://github.com/akretion/odoo-pim/tree/12.0/pim_attribute_set>`__
module in the PIM (Product Information Management) application developed
by `Akretion <https://akretion.com/>`__
