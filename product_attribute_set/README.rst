This module allows to display product's Attributes in product form views thanks to the `attribute_set <https://github.com/akretion/odoo-pim/tree/12.0/attribute_set>`_ module. It also adds a suggested link between product's Category and product's Attribute Set.

However this module **does not provide an Attribute menu** to easily manage product's Attribute as this feature is covered by the `pim_attribute_set <https://github.com/akretion/odoo-pim/tree/12.0/pim_attribute_set>`_ module in the PIM (Product Information Management) application developed by `Akretion <https://akretion.com/>`_
