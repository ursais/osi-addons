Sale Subscription - Suspension
==============================

Odoo Sale Subscription App does not allow to suspend a subscription and avoid
the creation of future invoices.

This module adds a new subscription stage "Suspended" and skip the creation of
invoices for suspended subscription.

Usage
=====

* Go to Subscriptions
* Create or open a subscription
* Click on 'Suspend' to move the stage to 'Suspended'. Future invoices will
  not be created.
* Click on 'Re-Activate' to move the stage to 'In Progress' and allow the
  creation of future invoices.
